Picture you and your friends have a travel adventure, road trip, wedding or other social event. Our idea was collaborative storytelling, where you and your friends could somehow post about the event together in real-time in a single blog/website post -- instead of all writing about it separately. </b>So that you could share your story together, because you did indeed experience it together.</b> A social journaling tool for sharing experiences via video, photos and text. An emotionally unique way to share your life with others, as it actually happened.

I worked on this project on and off for 3-4 years after college with a 3-person team.
I worked across the full stack, doing Javascript/HTML/CSS, Python (Djanjo), alogn with MySQL. We also used Bootstrap and Memcached, with Google App Engine.
I primarily designed and built features to share journals and entries, user login and authentication, notifications, and error handling, etc.

We applied to StartX in 2013, the Stanford startup accelerator, but were not accepted.
